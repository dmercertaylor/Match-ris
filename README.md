Match 3 Tetris

A mashup of the classic match-3 formula with tetris. Align colors in rows of columns of 3 to score points, and make chain reactions to build a multiplier.
Written for the 2D HTML5 Canvas renderer using object-oriented JavaScript.

## How to play
To score, align 3 or more blocks of the same color adjacent to one another on a row or column.
Each time you score earns points, and increases your point multiplier.
However, the point multiplier resets every time a new block drops, so try to score as many times as you can off a single block.
After every score, all unsupported blocks will fall until they land on something. Use this to your advantage to build up score chains, and boost your multiplier.
